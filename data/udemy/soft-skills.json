His company trains thousands of professionals and executives each year, for clients that include Microsoft, Amgen, Bayer, Caterpillar, Oracle, Volkswagen, Hewlett Packard, Maytag, Super 8 Motels and others. His association clients include The National Education Association, The American Medical Association, The National Association of Realtors, The Wisconsin Municipal League, The Cattleman&#039;s Beef Association and others.<\/p><p style=\"\">He has spoken, trained and coached in the US, Canada, Australia, Austria, Costa Rica, Colombia, Denmark, England, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Malaysia, Panama, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland and The Netherlands. Tens of thousands of people from four continents have studied with Doug in his Story Theater, Inspirational Leadership and Presentation Skills workshops and train-the trainer programs.<\/p><p style=\"\">Doug is the creator of The Story Theater Method for strategic storytelling in business and author of the book by the same name. He is also the creator of The How to Write and Deliver a Dynamite Speech System. He not only presents transformational speeches, he follows them by analyzing what he has just done. Not only does he make you laugh and cry, he teaches you how he does it. It&#039;s as if he&#039;s a magician who does a wonderful magic trick, and then takes you behind the curtain and shows you all of his secrets.<\/p><p style=\"\">What Doug Stevenson does is not magic. You can learn how to be a transformational speaker using his methods and technology. You can learn how to use acting, storytelling and drama techniques to connect with people at a deeper level. His motto? Emotion is the fast lane to the brain. The process?

He is the author of several courses on Udemy and has over 100 videos on YouTube.

Being married for over 24 years to the same woman both helped him do this job well and gave him an opportunity to enhance his own relationship.  <\/p>  <p>  \t             Currently, Michael has devoted himself to two endeavors.  One of them is helping people who stutter, stammer, have  fear of public speaking or otherwise want to improve their communication (speaking) skills speak more smoothly, fluently and confidently.  The other is helping people like himself who are called to teach reach their audiences as effectively and efficiently as humanly possible.  <\/p>  <p>  \t             In 2012 Michael was contacted by a wealthy Indian doctor who hired him, and flew him to India to coach his son who was also a doctor (Update: Michael has completed his second paid trip to India in November 2013 where he spent almost (4) weeks doing life and speech coaching).  This doctor found Michael on YouTube.  THIS event was a turning point for him because it clearly demonstrated the power of clarity, purpose, passion, dedication and video.  He had been working with people who stutter for over three years and wondered if he could ever really do this full time.  This experience answered his question and totally transformed his life, business and subsequently the lives of all of those whom he has coached since.  <\/p>  <p>  \t             More about the Michael the Speech Coach...  <\/p>  <p>  \t             For more than 20 years Michael struggled with stuttering, sometimes severe, and other times mild.  He always had this awareness of stuttering which in many ways controlled his life and limited him.  There were times when he would stutter so severely, he would bite his tongue trying to get a word out.  In school, he wouldn&#039;t volunteer to do certain things because it required him to read aloud or speak in public.  Even when he knew an answer, he would not raise his hand because he wasn&#039;t sure he could get the words out.  Although, he didn&#039;t completely let this hold him back, it did limit him greatly.  <\/p>  <p>  \t             Sometime in his mid twenties, he figured out that stuttering speech was not just physical, but was also psychological.  He realized that stuttering was as much a way of thinking as it was a way of speaking.  Therefore, if he could change his thinking and create a new way of speaking, he could start speaking well.  <\/p>  <p>  \t             THIS was the turning point for him.  Once he believed this, it gave him hope, courage and the perseverance he would need to stick in there with this process of changing his subconscious over the next several years or so. He also discovered that it would be better to focus on learning to speak well, by modeling great speakers, than to focus on trying to stop stuttering.  He didn&#039;t know it at the time, but this would be a great breakthrough.  <\/p>  <p>  \t             Michael focuses not on treating stuttering, but teaching and coaching people to speak more smoothly, fluently and confidently.  He has studied, taught and used accelerated learning strategies, and student success strategies.  He has worked in ministry, and as a Relationship Coach, so he knows the importance of having excellent communication skills.  Michael has taught live and online.  He&#039;s done live T.V. interviews, been on radio and even cable television.  He has taught classes in English and Spanish.  Although he hasn&#039;t worked with Spanish intensively in a while, he understands the challenges of learning new patterns of speech, and more importantly, how to overcome those challenges.  <\/p>","locale":"en_US","timeZone":"America\/Indiana\/Indianapolis","urlTitle":"michaelwilliams11","url":"https:\/\/wipro.udemy.com\/u\/michaelwilliams11\/","numFollowers":1593,"numFollowing":3,"personalWebsite":"http:\/\/pro90d.com","twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mwilliamsonline","google":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/102530288334990986758","facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/thestartspeakingtrainingcenter","youtube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/StartSpeakingAhora","linkedin":false,"images":{"img_50x50":"https:\/\/dujk9xa5fr1wz.cloudfront.net\/user\/50x50\/334286_eb2d_4.jpg","img_75x75":"https:\/\/dujk9xa5fr1wz.cloudfront.net\/user\/75x75\/334286_eb2d_4.jpg","img_100x100":"https:\/\/dujk9xa5fr1wz.cloudfront.net\/user\/100x100\/334286_eb2d_4.jpg","img_125_H":"https:\/\/dujk9xa5fr1wz.cloudfront.net\/user\/125_H\/334286_eb2d_4.jpg","img_200_H":"https:\/\/dujk9xa5fr1wz.cloudfront.net\/user\/200_H\/334286_eb2d_4.jpg"},"numTaughtCourses":9,"numVisibleTaughtCourses":6,"numSubscribedCourses":0,"numVisibleSubscribedCourses":0,"isFollowing":false},"images":{"img_50x50":"https:\/\/dujk9xa5fr1wz.cloudfront.net\/course\/50x50\/86192_1212_9.jpg","img_75x75":"https:\/\/dujk9xa5fr1wz.cloudfront.net\/course\/75x75\/86192_1212_9.jpg","img_100x100":"https:\/\/dujk9xa5fr1wz.cloudfront.net\/course\/100x100\/86192_1212_9.jpg","img_125_H":"https:\/\/dujk9xa5fr1wz.cloudfront.net\/course\/125_H\/86192_1212_9.jpg","img_200_H":"https:\/\/dujk9xa5fr1wz.cloudfront.net\/course\/200_H\/86192_1212_9.jpg","img_480x270":"https:\/\/dujk9xa5fr1wz.cloudfront.net\/course\/480x270\/86192_1212_9.jpg","img_304x171":"https:\/\/dujk9xa5fr1wz.cloudfront.net\/course\/304x171\/86192_1212_9.jpg","img_240x135":"https:\/\/dujk9xa5fr1wz.cloudfront.net\/course\/240x135\/86192_1212_9.jpg","img_96x54":"https:\/\/dujk9xa5fr1wz.cloudfront.net\/course\/96x54\/86192_1212_9.jpg","img_48x27":"https:\/\/dujk9xa5fr1wz.cloudfront.net\/course\/48x27\/86192_1212_9.jpg","img_750x422":"https:\/\/dujk9xa5fr1wz.cloudfront.net\/course\/750x422\/86192_1212_9.jpg"},"publishedTime":"2013-08-30 16:51:55","isPaid":false,"visibleInstructors":[{"__class":"user","id":"334286","title":"Michael Williams","name":"Michael","surname":"Williams","designation":"","jobTitle":"International Expert Speech Coach","description":"<p>  \t  Michael is the founder of The Start Speaking Training Center, LLC, author of &quot;Don&#039;t Try to Stop Stuttering, REPLACE It!&quot; and creator of The Pro90d Speech System.

\t<strong style=\"\">Sounds True<\/strong> was founded in 1985 by Tami Simon with a clear mission: to disseminate spiritual wisdom. Since starting out as a project with one woman and her tape recorder, we have grown into a multimedia publishing company with more than 80 employees, a library of more than 600 titles featuring some of the leading teachers and visionaries of our time, and an ever-expanding family of customers from across the world. In more than two decades of growth, change, and evolution, Sounds True has maintained its focus on its overriding purpose, as summed up in our Vision Statement:  <\/p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Sounds True exists to inspire, support, and serve personal transformation and spiritual awakening.<\/strong>  <\/p>  <p>  \t  Sounds True is an independent multimedia publishing company that embraces the world&#039;s major spiritual traditions, as well as the arts and humanities, embodied by the leading authors, teachers, and visionary artists of our time. Our approach to publishing is not dependent on a single format or technology\u2014rather, we strive with every title to preserve the essential &quot;living wisdom&quot; of the author, artist, or spiritual teacher. It is our goal to create products that not only provide information to a reader or listener, but that also embody the essential quality of a wisdom transmission between a teacher and a student.  <\/p>  <p>  \t  Throughout the years, Sounds True has developed a guiding philosophy that we call &quot;multiple bottom lines.&quot; Our dedication to this principle is embodied in our Mission Statement:  <\/p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">The mission of Sounds True is to find teachers and artists who serve as a gateway to spiritual awakening and to produce, publish, and distribute their work with beauty, intelligence, and integrity. We treat our authors, vendors, and partners in the same way we would want to be treated. We work flexibly and efficiently together to create a cooperative, loving environment that honors respectful authenticity and individual growth.

Since starting out as a project with one woman and her tape recorder, we have grown into a multimedia publishing company with more than 80 employees, a library of more than 600 titles featuring some of the leading teachers and visionaries of our time, and an ever-expanding family of customers from across the world. In more than two decades of growth, change, and evolution, Sounds True has maintained its focus on its overriding purpose, as summed up in our Vision Statement:  <\/p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Sounds True exists to inspire, support, and serve personal transformation and spiritual awakening.<\/strong>  <\/p>  <p>  \t  Sounds True is an independent multimedia publishing company that embraces the world&#039;s major spiritual traditions, as well as the arts and humanities, embodied by the leading authors, teachers, and visionary artists of our time. Our approach to publishing is not dependent on a single format or technology\u2014rather, we strive with every title to preserve the essential &quot;living wisdom&quot; of the author, artist, or spiritual teacher. It is our goal to create products that not only provide information to a reader or listener, but that also embody the essential quality of a wisdom transmission between a teacher and a student.  <\/p>  <p>  \t  Throughout the years, Sounds True has developed a guiding philosophy that we call &quot;multiple bottom lines.&quot; Our dedication to this principle is embodied in our Mission Statement:  <\/p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">The mission of Sounds True is to find teachers and artists who serve as a gateway to spiritual awakening and to produce, publish, and distribute their work with beauty, intelligence, and integrity. We treat our authors, vendors, and partners in the same way we would want to be treated. We work flexibly and efficiently together to create a cooperative, loving environment that honors respectful authenticity and individual growth. We maintain a healthy level of profitability so that we are an independent and sustainable employee-owned organization.<\/strong>  <\/p>  <p>  \t  The three essential bottom lines for Sounds True are the integrity of our purpose, the well-being of our people, and the maintaining of healthy profits.
