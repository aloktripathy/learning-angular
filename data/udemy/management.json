After several false starts, she taught herself to program in 2012 and wants to teach programming the way she wishes it had been explained to her. She spent 2014 attending Hacker School, a venture-funded workshop where developers focus on honing their craft. Some of her current projects are a software tool that allows you to program in plain English, and a flashcard app to help people study for exams. She has a master&#039;s degree in information security policy and management from Carnegie Mellon University and a bachelor&#039;s degree in journalism from Northwestern University.

This was his first application of organizational transformation.  <\/p>  <p>  \t        He has been consulting, writing and speaking about business organization and culture since 1973. After ten years with another consulting firm, he formed his own firm, the Miller Howard Consulting Group in 1983.

In 1999 he left that firm to focus on solo consulting projects.  <\/p>  <p>  \t        He and his firm were one of the early proponents of team-based management and worked with many clients to implement Team Management from the senior executive team to include every level and every employee in the organization.

This was his first application of organizational transformation.  <\/p>  <p>  \t        He has been consulting, writing and speaking about business organization and culture since 1973. After ten years with another consulting firm, he formed his own firm, the Miller Howard Consulting Group in 1983.

In 1999 he left that firm to focus on solo consulting projects.  <\/p>  <p>  \t        He and his firm were one of the early proponents of team-based management and worked with many clients to implement Team Management from the senior executive team to include every level and every employee in the organization.

In addition to directing the overall change process, Mr. Miller personally coached the senior management team of many of his clients.  <\/p>  <p>  \t        The implementation of Team Management led to the realization that the whole-system of the organization needed to be redesigned to create alignment so all systems, structure, skills, style and symbols support the same goals and culture.
